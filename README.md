# Audio Analyzer
A web app that provides a client with a handful of calculated audio-specific parameters upon uploading a file. This app is useful for audio content makers who want to be sure their tracks are compliant with industry/streaming platform specifications before going live, or just for an ordinary user who needs a quick and easy way to access info about their audio. 

(Right now, the user has to search web for a reliable software, download, install it, figure out how it works and might be able get the needed info, most possibly not for free. Meanwhile, Amazon Audio Book compliance checking service is not working.)
